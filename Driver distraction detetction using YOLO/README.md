# Driver distraction detection 

It was one of the models that I used in my graduation project that aims to provide safety for the driver.


## Dataset
I have collected 35000 images then converted its annotations into YOLO format.


## Model selection

I have used pretrained YOLOV4 with Darknet53 as a backbone architecture and fine-tuned it for this task.


## Training the model

I trained the model on google Colab and this is the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l1JTl0IO2YK_zOda_K5Qyy54sEtDPl3W?usp=sharing).
